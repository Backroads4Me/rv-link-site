Once you've [identified your switches](/configuration/identifying-switches/), it's time to create beautiful, functional dashboards tailored to your RV's layout.

## Creating Your First Dashboard

### Step 1: Plan Your Layout

Before diving into Home Assistant, sketch out what you want:

- **By Function**: Lights, Climate, Water, Power
- **By Location**: Bedroom, Living Area, Galley, Exterior
- **By Use Case**: Daily Controls, Monitoring, System Status

Most RV owners find a hybrid approach works best: primary tabs by function, with location-based sections within each tab.

### Step 2: Create a New Dashboard

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards**
2. Click **+ Add Dashboard** in the bottom right
3. Choose a name (e.g., "My RV")
4. Select **Start with an empty dashboard**

### Step 3: Add Views (Tabs)

Create tabs for different areas:

1. Click the **✏️ Edit** button
2. Click the **+ Add View** button
3. Create views for each area:
   - Lighting
   - Climate
   - Water & Tanks
   - Power & Batteries
   - Security
   - Systems

### Step 4: Add Cards

For each view, add cards to display and control your devices.

#### Common Card Types

**Entities Card** - Best for lists of related controls:
```yaml
type: entities
title: Living Area Lights
entities:
  - entity: switch.overhead_lights
    name: Overhead
  - entity: switch.reading_lights
    name: Reading Lights
  - entity: switch.accent_lights
    name: Accent
```

**Grid Card** - Best for button layouts:
```yaml
type: grid
columns: 2
cards:
  - type: button
    entity: switch.patio_light
    name: Patio
  - type: button
    entity: switch.awning_light
    name: Awning
```

**Gauge Card** - Best for tank levels:
```yaml
type: gauge
entity: sensor.tank_fresh_water
min: 0
max: 100
name: Fresh Water
```

**Energy Distribution Card** - For power flow:
```yaml
type: energy-distribution
entities:
  - entity: sensor.solar_power
  - entity: sensor.battery_power
  - entity: sensor.load_power
```

### Example: Lighting Dashboard

```yaml
views:
  - title: Lighting
    path: lighting
    cards:
      - type: vertical-stack
        cards:
          - type: markdown
            content: "## Interior Lights"

          - type: grid
            columns: 3
            cards:
              - type: button
                entity: switch.galley_lights
                name: Galley
                icon: mdi:silverware-fork-knife

              - type: button
                entity: switch.living_lights
                name: Living
                icon: mdi:sofa

              - type: button
                entity: switch.bedroom_lights
                name: Bedroom
                icon: mdi:bed

      - type: vertical-stack
        cards:
          - type: markdown
            content: "## Exterior Lights"

          - type: grid
            columns: 2
            cards:
              - type: button
                entity: switch.patio_light
                name: Patio
                icon: mdi:outdoor-lamp

              - type: button
                entity: switch.entry_light
                name: Entry
                icon: mdi:door
```

## Using YAML vs. Visual Editor

Home Assistant supports two methods for creating dashboards:

### Visual Editor (Recommended for Beginners)
- Click-and-drag interface
- Easy to get started
- Some limitations on advanced customization

### YAML Mode (Recommended for Sharing)
- Full control over layout and styling
- Easy to copy/paste and share
- Requires learning YAML syntax

**Pro Tip**: Start with the visual editor, then switch to YAML when you want to fine-tune or share your configuration.

## Exporting Your Dashboard

To share your dashboard with the community:

1. Open your dashboard
2. Click **✏️ Edit**
3. Click the **⋮** menu in the top right
4. Select **Raw configuration editor**
5. Copy the entire YAML configuration
6. Save it to a file (e.g., `my-rv-dashboard.yaml`)

## Importing a Dashboard

To use a dashboard shared by the community:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards**
2. Click **+ Add Dashboard**
3. Give it a name
4. Click **Create**
5. Click **✏️ Edit**
6. Click the **⋮** menu → **Raw configuration editor**
7. Paste the YAML configuration
8. Click **Save**

:::warning Entity IDs Must Match
When importing a dashboard from someone else, you'll need to update the entity IDs to match your system. For example, if their dashboard has `switch.galley_light` but yours is `switch.kitchen_light`, you'll need to find and replace those entity IDs.

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Button Row Card

Install the [Button Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) from HACS for highly customizable buttons.

### Picture Elements Card

Use images of your actual RV layout with clickable controls overlaid on top:

```yaml
type: picture-elements
image: /local/rv-floorplan.png
elements:
  - type: state-icon
    entity: switch.galley_lights
    tap_action:
      action: toggle
    style:
      top: 45%
      left: 30%
```

### Conditional Cards

Show cards only when relevant:

```yaml
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: binary_sensor.generator_running
    state: "on"
card:
  type: entities
  title: Generator Status
  entities:
    - sensor.generator_runtime
    - sensor.generator_load
```

### Custom Themes

Apply custom color schemes to match your RV or personal style. See [Home Assistant Themes](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#themes) for more info.

## Community Dashboard Sharing

### Finding Dashboards for Your RV

1. Visit the [RV-Link Forum](https://forum.rvlink.app)
2. Navigate to your RV manufacturer's category (e.g., Newmar, Tiffin, Entegra)
3. Browse posts tagged with your model and year
4. Download YAML files shared by other users

### Sharing Your Dashboard

Help grow the community by sharing your dashboard:

1. Export your dashboard YAML
2. Take screenshots of each view
3. Create a forum post in your RV manufacturer's category
4. Include:
   - RV make, model, and year
   - Description of your layout
   - Screenshots
   - YAML file (as an attachment or code block)
   - Any custom cards or integrations required

## Tips for Great Dashboards

1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overwhelm yourself with too many cards
2. **Group logically**: Put related controls together
3. **Use icons**: Visual icons are faster to recognize than text
4. **Test on mobile**: Most RV owners use tablets or phones
5. **Iterate**: Your first dashboard won't be perfect—refine as you use it
6. **Match your workflow**: Design around how you actually use your RV

## Troubleshooting

### Entity not available
- Verify the entity exists in Home Assistant
- Check if the device is online and reporting
- Ensure spelling is correct (entity IDs are case-sensitive)

### Card won't display
- Check YAML syntax for errors
- Ensure required integrations are installed
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Dashboard is slow
- Reduce the number of cards/entities per view
- Remove auto-updating cards for devices you rarely check
- Use conditional cards to hide unnecessary elements
