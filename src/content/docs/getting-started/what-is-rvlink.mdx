RV-Link is an open-source Home Assistant integration that bridges your RV's RV-C (Controller Area Network) to Home Assistant, giving you complete control and monitoring of your RV systems.

## The Problem

Modern RVs use the RV-C protocol to communicate between devices—lights, thermostats, tank sensors, batteries, and more. However, most factory control panels are limited, outdated, or don't provide the level of control and automation you want.

## The Solution

RV-Link connects directly to your RV's CAN bus and translates all that data into Home Assistant, where you can:

- **Control devices** from your phone, tablet, or voice assistant
- **Monitor everything** in real-time with beautiful dashboards
- **Automate routines** (e.g., turn off all lights at bedtime, monitor battery levels)
- **Customize everything** to fit your exact needs

## How It Works

*The diagram above shows the complete data flow from your RV's devices through to your phone or tablet.*

### The Components

1. **Hardware Bridge**: A Raspberry Pi with a CAN HAT physically connects to your RV's CAN bus wiring
2. **CAN-to-MQTT Bridge**: A Home Assistant add-on that reads RV-C messages and publishes them to MQTT
3. **Node-RED Processing**: Decodes RV-C data and translates it into Home Assistant-friendly format
4. **Home Assistant**: Creates entities, dashboards, and automations for all your devices

## What Can You Control?

RV-Link supports a wide range of RV-C devices:

### Lighting
- Interior lights (zone lighting)
- Individual light switches
- Dimming controls
- Exterior/patio lights

### Climate
- Thermostats
- HVAC systems
- Fans and vents

### Window Treatments
- Power shades
- Awnings

### Security
- Door locks
- Entry sensors

### Tanks & Water
- Fresh water tank level
- Grey water tank level
- Black water tank level
- Pump control

### Power Systems
- Battery voltage and state of charge
- Charger/inverter status and control
- Generator status and control
- Solar charge controllers
- AC and DC load monitoring
- Energy flow visualization

### And More
If it speaks RV-C, RV-Link can likely integrate it.

## Auto-Discovery: The Magic

Here's where RV-Link shines: it automatically discovers all devices on your RV-C network and creates Home Assistant entities for them.

When you first power on RV-Link, you'll see switches appear as `switch_1`, `switch_2`, etc. To identify what each switch controls:

1. Walk around your RV
2. Toggle physical switches
3. Watch your Home Assistant dashboard
4. When you see a switch turn on, you know what it controls
5. Rename and organize as you like

## Sharing Dashboard Configurations

Once you've identified and organized your switches, you can share your dashboard configuration with others who have the same RV model. Similarly, you can download configurations from the community forum.

This collaborative approach means:
- New users can get up and running faster
- Community members help each other
- Everyone benefits from shared knowledge

## Open Source & Extensible

RV-Link is built on open-source software:
- **Home Assistant**: The smart home platform
- **Node-RED**: Flow-based automation
- **MQTT**: Lightweight messaging protocol
- **Python/JavaScript**: Easy to customize and extend

You have complete access to the code and can customize anything to fit your needs.
