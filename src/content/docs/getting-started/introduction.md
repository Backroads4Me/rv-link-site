RV-Link transforms your RV into a smart home by bridging your RV's RV-C (Controller Area Network) to Home Assistant. Control and monitor everything from lights and shades to tanks and batteries—all from your phone or tablet.

## What You'll Get

- **Automatic Device Discovery**: RV-Link finds all RV-C devices on your network and creates Home Assistant entities automatically
- **Real-Time Control**: Toggle switches, adjust thermostats, and control pumps instantly
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track tank levels, battery voltage, charger status, and energy flow
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Create beautiful interfaces tailored to your RV
- **Community-Driven**: Share and download dashboard configurations from other users with the same RV model

## Three Ways to Get Started

Choose the path that fits your comfort level and goals:

### 1. Pre-Assembled Kit
Purchase a fully built, tested, and configured device. Just plug it in and configure WiFi. Perfect if you want to get up and running quickly.

### 2. DIY Build + Pre-Configured Image
Build your own hardware following our detailed assembly guide, then flash our custom Home Assistant OS image. Best balance of hands-on experience and convenience.

### 3. Full Manual Installation
Build the hardware and manually install each Home Assistant add-on. Complete control for tinkerers who want to understand every component.
